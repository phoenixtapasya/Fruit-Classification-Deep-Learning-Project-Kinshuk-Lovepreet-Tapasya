# Fruit-Classification-Deep-Learning-Project-Kinshuk-Lovepreet-Tapasya
This repository contains our Deep Learning Group Project built by Tapasya (102215341), Kinshuk (102215015), and Lovepreet (102215167). The goal of the project is to classify fruit images using a pretrained EfficientNetB0 model with transfer learning and fine-tuning, especially when a large fruit dataset is not available.
